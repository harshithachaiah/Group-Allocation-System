Students attend a series of seminars given by researchers from universities or companies followed by group discussions, some of which are moderated by a member of staff. Students also attend two workshopsÂ on skills that are particularly relevant to the module. Resources on other skills that are also high up on the value chain of any IT employer are made available on this Blackboard site.</p>
